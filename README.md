## Motivation

The motive behind this project was to demonstrate the functionality behind jQuery and Bootstrap. 

jQuery is one of the lighter frameworks that exists for javascript. It can accomplish the same things that javescript does, but with fewer lines of code. Though there is a debate to be had about whether or not jQuery - in today's digital landscape - is still as useful as it once was, it still has its uses, in particular with older Internet Explorer versions, Ajax requests, and even large client-side applications.

Bootstrap is also a framework, comprised of HTML, CSS and javascript. Additionally, it is quite responsive for different devices and web browsers, highly customizable, is constantly being updated and supported to maintain a high standard of integrity.

Each one can help expedite the creation of a website or application by providing pre-built blocks of code that can easily be called upon, as opposed to creating everything from the ground up. Progress can be accelerated even further when used in unison. Given such utility, this project was made to be able to gain familiarity with both frameworks, and to be able to work more efficiently for most applications in the future.
